description: This system combined a baseline method with a Deep Clustering method.
  Specifically, we trained an autoregressive neural network model for phoneme classification
  using pseudo-labels obtained by clustering outputs of a CPC network with k-means,
  and then executing the second-round clustering with the outputs of the final layer
  of the autoregressive model. We used a CPC-big baseline model which was trained
  on Libri-light 6k as a seed model, and used LibriSpeech 960h for pseudo-label phoneme
  classification tasks by constructing the same network as the CPC-big model except
  that the hidden unit size was 1024 units. We adopted a BERT-small model on LibriSpeech
  960h for LM training. Experimental results show that relative improvements in the
  ABX metric of 4.8 - 8.8 % are achieved compared to a baseline method (CPC-big) on
  dev-clean dataset.
