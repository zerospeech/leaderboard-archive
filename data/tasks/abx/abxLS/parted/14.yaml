description: This system combined a baseline method with a Deep Clustering method.
  Specifically, we trained an autoregressive neural network model for phoneme classification
  using pseudo-labels obtained by clustering outputs of a CPC network with k-means,
  and then executing the second-round clustering with the outputs of the final layer
  of the autoregressive model. We used LibriSpeech 460h data for CPC training and
  phoneme classification. In both tasks, we adopted the same network as a CPC-small
  model, but we replaced a Transformer layer with a Conformer one for CPC training.
  We utilized a BERT-small model on LibriSpeech 960h for LM training. Experimental
  results show that our method outperforms a baseline (CPC-big+km50+BERT-small) in
  sWUGGY metric.
