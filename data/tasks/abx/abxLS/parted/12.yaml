description: This system combined a baseline method with a Deep Clustering method.
  Specifically, we trained an autoregressive neural network model for phoneme classification
  using pseudo-labels obtained by clustering outputs of a CPC network with k-means,
  and then executing the second-round clustering with the outputs of the final layer
  of the autoregressive model. We used a CPC-big baseline model which was trained
  on Libri-light 6k as a seed model, and used LibriSpeech 960h for pseudo-label phoneme
  classification tasks by constructing the same network as the CPC-big model. We adopted
  a BERT-small model on LibriSpeech 960h for LM training. Experimental results show
  that a relative improvement in the sBLIMP score of 2.3 % is achieved compared to
  a baseline method (CPC-big+km50+BERT-small).
