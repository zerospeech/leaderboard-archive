description: 'HuBERT model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447) trained on librispeech
  960,  3rd iteration. 1st iteration: discrete targets obtained by clustering MFCC  features
  with k-means (k=100). 2nd iteration: discrete targets obtained  by clustering 6th-layer
  features of 1st iteration with k-means (k=500). 3rd iteration: discrete targets
  obtained by clustering 12th-layer features  of 2nd iteration with k-means (k=500).
  ABX is reported on the targets features  used to train the 3rd iteration.
