description: Information Retrieval to ZeroSpeech 2021. In our submission we have decided
  to verify the limits of information retrieval approaches to acoustic representations,
  word-spotting and word semantics discovery. For ABX we have projected the embeddings
  of the baseline model into the nullspace of a speaker classification model, to make
  the embeddings less speaker sensitive. We perform a k-means clustering of embeddings
  (based on cosine distances) for quantization for other tasks. Additionally, we apply
  the following technique for ABX on top of embeddings -  we use the centers of the
  obtained clusters, and we move each embedding a part of the distance (e.g. half)
  in the direction of the closest cluster's center. This aims to include information
  about the whole dataset coming from clustering without substantial loss of local
  information, as a kind of denoising. For sWUGGY we provide for each query word the
  negative of the minimum dynamic time warping cost of matching a given word to the
  subsequences of the Librispeech960 corpus. This essentially attempts to perform
  a dictionary lookup - real words should match with a low score, while artificial
  words should match with a higher one. For sSIMI we segment the sequences of pseudophonemes
  into words using SentencePiece, we then learn the embeddings of discovered pseudo-words
  using word embedding approaches. We then map the pseudophones of the query word
  to the nearest discovered pseudoword. For sBLIMP we provide LM scores, similarly
  to the baseline.
