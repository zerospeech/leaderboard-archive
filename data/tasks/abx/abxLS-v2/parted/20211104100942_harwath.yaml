description: Our model is a variant of the FaST-VGS (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08186).
  Which augments the audio encoder of FaST-VGS with additional transformer layers
  and the loss with wav2vec2.0-type contrastive loss. We jointly trained the model
  on SpokenCOCO for speech-image matching and LibriSpeech for audio frame-level contrastive
  modeling. The language modeling part (i.e. KMeans quantization and BERT training)
  is the same as the high budget VG baseline.
