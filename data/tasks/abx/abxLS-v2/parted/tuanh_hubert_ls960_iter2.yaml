description: 'HuBERT model (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447) trained on librispeech
  960,  2nd iteration. 1st iteration: discrete targets obtained by clustering MFCC  features
  with k-means (k=100). 2nd iteration: discrete targets obtained  by clustering 6th-layer
  features of 1st iteration with k-means (k=500). ABX is reported on the targets features
  used to train the 2nd iteration.
