description: In this model, we use a CPC segmentation module to generate boundaries
  of audios (removed most silence segments by VAD). Then we average the features from
  pretrained CPC-big within the adjacent boundaries and use kmeans to get pseudo units.
  A roberta model is used to train the language models.
