description: Our submission uses the baseline CPC model. For ABX, we remove speaker
  identity with a linear projection and average representations with k-Means centroids
  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11603). For other tasks, we use pseudo-phones derived
  with a self-trained segmenting language model without speaker normalization. In
  the lexical and syntactic task, we ensemble AWD-LSTMs trained directly on those
  representations. In the semantic task, we train a word2vec model on pseudo-words
  found using the segmentation of pseudo-phone sequences.
