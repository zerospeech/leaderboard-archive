description: Information Retrieval to ZeroSpeech 2021. In our submission we have decided
  to verify the limits of information retrieval approaches to acoustic representations,
  word-spotting and word semantics discovery. For ABX we use baseline representations.
  For other tasks we use baseline k-means clustering for quantization. For sWUGGY
  we provide for each query word the minimum cost of edit-distance matching a given
  word to the Librispeech960 corpus. This essentially attempts to perform a dictionary
  lookup - real words should match with a low score, while artificial words should
  match with a higher one. For sSIMI we segment the sequences of pseudophonemes into
  words using SentencePiece, we then learn the embeddings of discovered pseudo-words
  using word embedding approaches. We then map the pseudophones of the query word
  to the nearest discovered pseudoword. For sBLIMP we provide LM scores, similarly
  to the baseline.
